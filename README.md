# yumCoffee
I want to appreciate the coffee I drink while coding by coding about coffee! 

For now, I will be working with a dataset I create based on what I would call my "flavor profile". 

What I hope to do in the future is get enough information on my own tastes to figure out how to predict what coffee I would like based on what I like already, what stores are available to me, and my price range. So, I will also have to make a dataset on the different coffees being sold at stores near me. (What a project! Phew.)
